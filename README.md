## SoCmodder's Android Snippets!

I created this repo as a place for me to keep commonly used classes, custom views, and other examples from the Android ecosystem in order to create a place for myself and others to grab lightweight pieces of code to help out with their projects.

### Contact
If you have any questions, would like to help out, or anything else, feel free to reach out to me at socmodder@gmail.com.
